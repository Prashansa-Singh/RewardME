## Introduction

We used to have hundreds of physical paper cards for coffee, noodles, donut, bread, meat, fish, chicken, veggie, burger, candy, cake, icecream, sports, sneakers, gym and swim and spa sessions, and of course D&D sessions as well; basically anything you can think of we had it at one point and we carried a stack of reward cards around. But fear no more, RewardME captures them all for you now (╯°□°)╯︵◓!

RewardME is the platform for both businesses and customers. Businesses can register for a business account to promote their shops and customers can get a user account to store their reward cards in the RewardME wallet.

### Storytime

> Ed has a teahouse and he wants to promote his business by using a reward card system. Ed wants some _sustainable, convenient, and socially impactful_ ways to do that, so he chose RewardME. Prashan loves to drink tea more than coffee, so she visits the teahouse quite often. Whenever Prashan buys a pack of beauty tea, she collects a stamp on her Ed’s teahouse card in her RewardME wallet. When she has _e_ number of stamps, she can redeem a digestive tea pack.
 
Did we mention that shops can design their own reward plans? Yes, they can! Also, RewardME has a discovery tab for business promotions. Be featured in the Discover page for being sustainable.
